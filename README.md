# ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ Data Analysis Repository

Welcome to my Data Analysis repository! This is a collection of various data analysis projects that I've worked on. Each project is self-contained and includes the data, scripts, and results of the analysis.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The code uses Python 3.7 and several Python libraries. You can install the necessary libraries with pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Each project is in its own directory. Navigate to a project directory and run the scripts there. For example:

```bash
cd project1
python analysis.py
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Projects

Here, is a brief overview of each project in this repository : 

<h1>Project 1 : </h1> Data Analysis on Recent Indian Lok Sabha Elections
                  This project aims to analyze the results of the recent 2024 Indian Lok Sabha elections. The                         analysis focuses on various aspects such as the distribution of winning candidates, age                                demographics, party performance, and the impact of key political figures..
                  The project uses Python for data analysis, with libraries such as pandas, matplotlib and seaborn for                   data manipulation and visualization. The data is sourced from various news articles and official                       election result announcements.
                  This analysis provides valuable insights into the changing political landscape of India and can help                   political analysts, researchers, and the general public understand the factors that influenced the                     election results.
